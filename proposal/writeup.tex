\maketitle

For our final project, we are interested in exploring classification
techniques to classify facial emotions. Specifically, we would like
to explore two methods that have been used in facial recognition.
The first is to use principal component analysis to represent facial
images in the basis of the first principal components and classify the
resulting features with a multiclass classifier. In this part of the
project, we want to understand and implement PCA and apply
classification methods learned in class (neural networks, multiclass SVM).

The second method we want to explore is using convolutional neural networks
on the raw images. In this part of the project, we want to understand
and optimize the network structure of the CNN and compare its performance
to the other methods along various performance metrics (correctness, training
time, amount of training data required). We plan to use existing CNN libraries,
and refer to the methods and results of Lawrence et. al. \cite{Lawrence} and
Matsugu et. al. \cite{Matsugu}.

This project can be clearly divided into using PCA for feature
extraction from images for classification and using convolutional
neural networks for classification with little image preprocessing.
The project could then follow the rough timeline:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement a baseline classifier using PCA and a neural network
classifier. Evaluate the performance in terms of correctness, training time,
and amount of training data required.
\item Refine and add features to the baseline classifier. Implement a
multiclass SVM classifier with PCA features and evaluate.
\item Implement a convolutional neural network classifier using existing
libraries.
\item Refine and compare the CNN to the other methods explored.
\end{enumerate}

Our goals in this project are to learn more about PCA and CNNs and their
application to image processing and classification. However we recognize
that there are some risks associated with this proposal, because we do
not have background in either. However, because this project is a
comparison study of several approaches, we hope to have sufficient
analysis on this relatively standard classification problem.
